      "Answer: A laceration is an injury to the skin caused by an irregular tear, often resulting in hemorrhage and traumatization of the margins, with bridging strands of tissue at the base. In contrast, an incision is a wound made by a sharp object, with clean margins and no bridging tissue. The key difference is that lacerations tend to leave scars, while incisions can be closed with sutures, resulting in minimal or no scarring.\n"
