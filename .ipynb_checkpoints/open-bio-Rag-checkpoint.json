        "question": "How does HER2 protein influence breast cancer?",
        "answer": "HER2 is a specific type of protein that can promote the growth of cancer cells, including breast cancer cells. It stands for Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2. In some types of breast cancers, there is an overexpression or amplification of the HER2 gene, which leads to increased production of HER2 protein. This overexpression can contribute to more aggressive tumor growth and a higher risk of recurrence. Targeted therapies have been developed to specifically attack HER2-positive breast cancer cells, such as trastuzumab (Herceptin), which is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the HER2 protein and inhibits its activity."

        "question": "What is the role of p53 in tumor suppression?",
        "answer": "The p53 gene plays a crucial role in suppressing tumors. It acts as a tumor suppressor gene, which means it helps prevent cells from growing and dividing uncontrollably, thus reducing the risk of cancer development. When the p53 gene is mutated or altered, its ability to regulate cell growth is impaired, leading to uncontrolled cell division and an increased risk of tumor formation. Therefore, the p53 gene is essential in maintaining cellular integrity and preventing the initiation and progression of tumors."
