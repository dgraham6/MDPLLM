        "question": "What is the role of a pathologist in cancer diagnosis?",
        "answer": "A pathologist plays a crucial role in cancer diagnosis by observing the cellular pattern of tissue samples under a microscope to determine if a sample is cancerous or non-cancerous (benign). Wide range of diseases, including cancer, and the vast majority of cancer diagnoses are made by pathologists (1). Our Residency Program trains candidates in the diagnosis of disease.\n\nSource: (1) Unknown, likely from the original text provided."

        "question": "What is the significance of HER2 status in breast cancer pathology?",
        "answer": "The significance of HER2 status in breast cancer pathology is that it is a strong predictor of response to targeted therapy, particularly trastuzumab (Herceptin). HER2-positive breast cancers have a worse prognosis than HER2-negative tumors and are more likely to recur and spread. According to the American Cancer Society, \"Knowing whether a breast cancer is HER2-positive or HER2-negative helps guide treatment decisions.\" (Source: American Cancer Society, \"HER2-Positive Breast Cancer\".)"

    {
        "question": "What is the process for conducting a fine-needle aspiration biopsy?",
        "answer": "A fine-needle aspiration biopsy is a procedure that involves using a thin needle to collect a sample of cells or tissue from a suspicious area in the body. The needle is inserted into the area, and a small amount of fluid or cells is drawn into a syringe, which is then sent to a laboratory for examination. This type of biopsy can be used to diagnose a variety of medical conditions, including cancer and benign growths. \n\nThis information came from: Retrieved from <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy>."
