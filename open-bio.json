        "question": "What is immunohistochemistry and how is it used in cancer diagnosis?",
        "answer": "Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a technique that uses antibodies to identify specific proteins or antigens within tissue samples, such as biopsies or surgical specimens. It is commonly used in the diagnosis of cancer to help determine the type of tumor and its characteristics.\nThe process involves first obtaining a tissue sample from the patient. This can be done through various methods like biopsy needles or surgical procedures. The sample is then prepared for IHC by embedding it in paraffin wax, cutting thin sections, and placing them on glass slides.\nNext, specific antibodies are selected based on the target antigen they bind to. These antibodies are labeled with a marker that allows for easy detection under a microscope. The labeled antibodies are applied to the tissue section, and if the antigen is present, it will bind to the antibody.\nThe slide is then examined under a microscope to observe the binding of the antibodies to the antigens. This helps in identifying specific proteins or markers associated with different types of cancer cells. For example, certain cancers may express high levels of hormone receptors like estrogen receptor (ER) or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), which can influence treatment decisions.\nIHC is valuable in diagnosing cancer as it provides information about tumor type, grade, and potential targets for therapy. It can also help predict the likelihood of metastasis and recurrence, aiding in treatment planning and prognosis estimation."

        "answer": "Exfoliative cytology is a diagnostic procedure used to detect cancerous cells by examining cells that have been shed from various parts of the body. Pathologists use specific criteria and techniques to identify cancer in these samples.  One important criterion for identifying cancer is the presence of abnormal cellular morphology, which includes changes in size, shape, and staining characteristics of the cells. Cancer cells often appear larger than normal with irregular borders and may have varying amounts of cytoplasm or nucleus. Pathologists carefully examine these features under a microscope to make an initial assessment of whether the cells are cancerous.  Another crucial factor is the ratio of abnormal cells to normal cells within the sample. In certain cancers, such as cervical or oral cancer, a high percentage of abnormal cells can be indicative of malignancy. Pathologists evaluate this ratio by examining multiple fields of view and calculating the number of abnormal cells in relation to the total number of cells present.  Additionally, pathologists consider the overall pattern of growth and arrangement of cells. Cancer cells typically grow in an unorganized manner with disordered architecture, unlike normal cells that usually form organized structures. This disorganization becomes evident when examining the sample under a microscope.  Furthermore, pathologists assess the nuclear features of the cells. In cancerous cells, the nuclei are often larger than normal and may have irregular contours or abnormal staining patterns. These atypical"
